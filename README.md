`Q. Could you give me some examples of Pascal programming?`


Here are some tasks you can try to practice your Pascal programming skills:

1. **Hello, User!**: Write a program that prompts the user for their name and then prints a personalized greeting, like "Hello, [Name]!".

2. **Arithmetic Calculator**: Write a program that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input from the user, performs the specified operation, and prints the result.

3. **Factorial**: Write a program that computes the factorial of a given positive integer using both iteration and recursion.

4. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Write a program that generates the first N Fibonacci numbers, where N is a positive integer provided by the user. Implement both iterative and recursive solutions.

5. **Prime Numbers**: Write a program that prints all prime numbers between 1 and a given positive integer N provided by the user.

6. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: Write a program that calculates the GCD of two positive integers using Euclid's algorithm.

7. **Array Sorting**: Write a program that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using different sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.

8. **Palindrome Checker**: Write a program that checks if a given word or phrase is a palindrome (reads the same backward and forward). The program should ignore spaces, punctuation, and case sensitivity.

9. **Basic File Operations**: Write a program that reads a text file and counts the number of lines, words, and characters in it. The program should also create a new file with the same content but all characters in uppercase.

10. **Simple Address Book**: Create a program that allows the user to manage an address book with basic operations like adding, deleting, and searching for contacts. You can store the contacts in a file or an in-memory data structure, such as an array or a linked list.

These tasks cover a range of programming concepts, from basic input/output and control structures to more advanced topics like recursion, file handling, and data structures. As you work through these tasks, you'll gain a better understanding of Pascal programming and improve your problem-solving skills.
